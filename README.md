MSX2 MARTIAN WAR GAME

This game is a remake of very old Martian War for WANG 2200 Computers by Ralf Berger in 1980.

You can find some info about the original game here:

It's my first assembly MSX game.

The game format is ROM.

It's for MSX2 computers only because it use Screen 0 text mode with 80 columns.

I will appreace each suggestion to write a code more clean.

The sound effects are not implemented at the moment and I will be very happy if someone would help me write some code to simulate the sound of explosions and falling missiles because I haven't experience in this field.
